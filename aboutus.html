            <p>
                Hi my name is Morgan, I am a Software Engineer. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/mestanley813" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                This assignment was an interesting one for me as I typically spend my time on the back-end of web applications. 
                Being able to put myself in the shoes of the Front-End Engineer that I work with was an eye opening experience as I realized how intricate the work they do is.
                I left this assignment with a greater understanding of how they perform certain tasks, and will hopefully be able to assist with minor updates if necessary.
                In the past, I have used tools such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">React</a> and <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.JS</a> in order to quickly create web applications, however, I wanted to challenge myself and see how well I could do creating a website completely from scratch.
                Overall, this was a nostalgic experience and I particularly enjoyed the Javascript portion of this assignment.
            </p>

                Without a time limit I could spend weeks tweaking this site in order to be satisfied.
                Ideally I would want to update this website so that it is responsive, and works across all mobile devices. 
                Additionally, given more time, I would also want to create an animation for the home page chart. 
                I think if I added some Javascript libraries I could really make this site look more professional.
